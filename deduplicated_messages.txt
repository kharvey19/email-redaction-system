Date: Monday, September 2, 2024 9:13 AM

Hi Jill,
Just looping back on the hallway incident from last Friday. Clara Benson and Hunter Schaffer were both involved — it seems Clara may have started it, but Hunter escalated things. I’ve asked Officer Daniels to check the hallway cameras. We’ll need to schedule a meeting with their parents sometime this week. Also, please remind the security staff that any follow-up needs to go directly to discipline@d123.org.
Best,
Katie

Hi Team,
I’ve noticed that Grace Johnson has been falling behind in both English and Science. She failed the last two quizzes and has been absent three times in the past two weeks. I checked with her teachers, and it looks like there may be something going on at home. Please reach out to her parents. Also, her school email is gjohnson@student.d123.org in case we want to send her a wellness check message.
Thanks,
